**New Features:**

- **PRISM Cloud Agent**: Alignments of PRISM DID method between PRISM Cloud Agent and PRISM Node. All APIs are backward compatible, but support more options:
    1. Add ability to define JSON-LD “@context” during DID creation
    2. Add ability to update JSON-LD “@context” via PatchContext action during DID update
    3. Add ability to define multiple service types in DID document
    4. Add ability to define service endpoint as a URI, list of URIs or a JSON in DID document.
    5. DID document metadata now have “created” and “updated” timestamp
- **PRISM Cloud Agent**: Webhook events introduced. Starting from version `v1.9.2`, PRISM Cloud Agent is able to notify user about DID publishing, Connection, Issue Credential, and Present Proof state changes with events via configurable webhook.
  - For the full list of available events and usage example, please check the [latest documentation about webhooks and events.](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/webhooks/webhook).
- **PRISM Cloud Agent**: `thid` field added to all Connection, Credential and Present Proof records. `thid` is a unique identifier of the thread for each record. Starting from version `v1.9.2`, one could use `thid` to get the required record using Rest API and establish one to one mapping between credential requests and presentation proofs on Issuer, Holder and Verifier sides.
  - Check the updated [API specification](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/agent-api) for more details about `thid` field.
- **Infrastructure**: Grafana Cloud is now used to provide infrastructure for all services.
  - Continuous deployments to k8s cluster added for all PRISM components, helm charts moved to individual repositories.
