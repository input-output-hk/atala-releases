**New Features:**

- **PRISM Cloud Agent**:
  - Repository is now public and all commits contain Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off, Contribution guidelines and [new extensive README.md](https://github.com/input-output-hk/atala-prism-building-blocks/blob/main/README.md) about Cloud Agent with running instructions and examples.
  - Cloud Agent docker container runtime parameters configuration documentation is now available [here](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/docs/atala-prism/prism-cloud-agent/environment-variables)
  - Cloud Agent processing pipeline parameters (`*_BG_JOB_RECORDS_LIMIT`, `*_BG_JOB_RECURRENCE_DELAY`, `*_BG_JOB_PROCESSING_PARALLELISM` for issuance, connection and present-proof flows) are now available for configuration. These parameters let you configure how fast Cloud Agent threads will process the records and how many records will be taken for processing in parallel from the database simultanously. You could experiment with the values to get the maximum performance and reduce processing delays. Full description of the parameters is available on the [environment variables section](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/docs/atala-prism/prism-cloud-agent/environment-variables) of docs portal.
  - Full presentation record is now returned instead of only presentation record ID when a new presentation request is created via [`/present-proof/presentations/` endpoint](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/agent-api/#tag/Present-Proof/operation/requestPresentation)
  - Out-of-band invitation created by the Inviter in [the connection protocol](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/connections/connection) will now expire by default (moved to `InvitationExpired` state) after 5 minutes. This timeout is configurable via `CONNECT_INVITATION_EXPIRY` environment variable. For more information about the configuration parameter, please check [environment variables section](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/docs/atala-prism/prism-cloud-agent/environment-variables).
- **Atala PRISM Wallet SDK TypeScript**:
  - Pluto (storage interface) implementation moved to example application and is not part of the SDK anymore. The storage interface is now to be implemented on the application side, which allows for more flexibility with regards to secure storage solutions.
  - `MnemonicWordList` parameter when generating a new mnemonic should now contain 12 or 24 words.
  - `Castor.createPrismDID` function to create PRISM DID is now accepting `KeyPair` parameter. `PublicKey` input parameter is kept for backward compatibility. 
- **All PRISM SDKs**:
  - Added support for PRISM Mediator:
    - base64 attachments format in Pickup v3.0 protocol
    - `return_route` header support for sync messages
  - Bug fixes and intermediate work for Anoncreds support
