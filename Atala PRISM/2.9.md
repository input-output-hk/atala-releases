  - **BREAKING CHANGES**:
    - PrivateKey.index type now is `number | undefined` PrivateKey.index was returning a `string`. It's possible where that's being used (ie Pluto) will need to handle the new `number | undefined` type
    - The SDK is now exported as default, in order to import it use `import sdk from '@atala/prism-wallet-sdk'` vs `import * as sdk from '@atala/prism-wallet-sdk'`. Browsers now also don't need to build complex webpack configuration, check the demos for more info.
