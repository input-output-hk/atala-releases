## Changelog

**New Features:**

- **PRISM Cloud Agent**: **[ BREAKING CHANGE ]** Credential schema validation added in the credential issuance flow
  - Credential schema validation is now performed during the credential issuance proof flow
  - Starting from version `v1.5.1`, `schemaId` parameter is required in the credential issuance flow (before, it was basically ignored and no validation was performed)
  - Issued `claims` should correspond to the schema definition, otherwise, the credential issuance will fail
- **PRISM Cloud Agent**: **[ BREAKING CHANGE ]** New secret storage for PRISM and Peer DIDs key material
  - New service Hashicorp Vault is added and used to store key material for PRISM and Peer DIDs
  - Instead of unsecure PostgreSQL database, Peer DID key material is now saved in a secure Hashicorp Vault storage enhancing security and reliability
  - Public and private key pairs for PRISM DIDs are generated on-the-fly in memory each time the PRISM Cloud Agent needs them removing the need to store them in a database
  - New `WALLET_SEED` parameter is now available to configure the seed for the PRISM DID generation allowing re-starting the PRISM Cloud Agent without losing control over previously created DIDs
  - **All previously created PRISM DIDs are now invalidated and cannot be used anymore (!)**
  - Please, see the full documentation about this new feature and configuration parameters [here](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/category/secret-management).
- **Swift SDK**: new cryptographic abstraction for HSM allowing to implement a custom cryptographic providers (documentation is coming soon)
