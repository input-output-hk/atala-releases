**New Features:**

- **PRISM Cloud Agent**:
  - Multi-Tenancy first iteration provides a data isolation layer for multi-tenant wallets inside an agent. Refer to the newly added documentation on Multi-Tenancy [Concept](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/docs/concepts/multi-tenancy)[On-boarding](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/multitenancy/tenant-onboarding), [Webhook notifitations](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/webhooks/webhook), [Authentication](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/docs/atala-prism/prism-cloud-agent/authentication), as well as augmented [Environment variables](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/docs/atala-prism/prism-cloud-agent/environment-variables).
    - **[ BREAKING CHANGE ]** Multi-Tenancy introduces a change and users must recreate the assets after migration to this version of the Agent. It’s possible to implement the migration script if it’s really needed. Technically, in Multi-Tenancy, RLS policies are used in the Postgresql database. In order to simplify the migration, the tables related to the wallet assets (VC, Schemas, Policies, DIDs) will be cleaned up from data. User can recreate the DID:Prism if it was initialized from the seed value before the release. All other entities are cleaned-up.
    - In order to run the Agent in the single-tenant mode the following configuration (environment variables) must be set:
        `API_KEY_ENABLED=false`
        `API_KEY_AUTHENTICATE_AS_DEFAULT_USER=false`
    - The following environment variables were renamed:
        `DEFAULT_WALLET_SEED`
        `DEFAULT_WALLET_WEBHOOK_URL`
        `DEFAULT_WALLET_WEBHOOK_API_KEY`
  - Improve security by APISIX routing configuration and rewrite-response plugin to set effective security headers as well as a traceable request ID.
  - Metrics are collected for (TO CONFIRM IF IT IS FOR USERS; IF NOT, DELETE):
    - Connection flow
    - Issuance flow
    - Verification flow
- **Atala PRISM Wallet SDK Swift**:
  - Keys will be saved on the keychain.
