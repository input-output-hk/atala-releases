*"Atala PRISM Cloud Agent" component renamed to "Open Enterprise Agent"*

**New Features:**

- **Open Enterprise Agent**:
  - ***[BREAKING CHANGE]*** Starting from v1.18.0, in addition to JWT Verifiable Credentials, Open Enterprise Agent supports issuance of the [Hyperledger AnonCreds](https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/). Important notes:
    - New `credentialFormat` field is now available when creating a credential offer. It allows to specify the format of the credential to be issued. `JWT` and `AnonCreds` are now supported.
    - `credentialJWT` field of the `CredentialRecord` was renamed to `credential` to reflect the fact that it can now contain both JWT and AnonCreds credentials.
    - Please, check the updated documentation for more information:
      * New [AnonCreds credential definition tutorials](https://docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/category/credential-definition) as prerequisites to issue AnonCreds
      * Updated [VC issuance tutorial](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/credentials/issue) with the new AnonCreds tabs
      * Updated [VC issuance REST API reference](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/agent-api/#tag/Issue-Credentials-Protocol/operation/createCredentialOffer)
- **PRISM Mediator**:
  - [Report Problem 2.0](https://didcomm.org/report-problem/2.0/) is now supported. It allows to report problems with the message processing. For example, if the message is malformed or the recipient is not found. Please, check the full list of supported error messages [here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/atala-prism-mediator/blob/main/Mediator-Error_Handling.md).
- **Atala PRISM Wallet SDKs**:
  - ***[BREAKING CHANGE]*** TypeScript and Swift SDKs are now able to achieve and store AnonCreds credentials in addition to JWT. As Open Enterprise Agent issuance API was changed, the SDKs were updated to reflect the changes. Please, make sure you update your SDKs to the latest version to be able to work with AnonCreds credentials.
  - ***[BREAKING CHANGE]*** Pluto module is introducing a new credential abstraction and undergoing some changes. Before, x25519 keys were wrongly set as EC key types that was incorrect. EC25519 + Secp256k1 belong to EC key type, X25519 should have Curve25519 instead to be valid. If you previously had a key stored as EC (x25519) changing that `keyType` to `KeyTypes.X25519` (Curve25519).
  - ***Restriction*** KMM SDK is not able to work with AnonCreds credentials yet. It will be added in the next release.
