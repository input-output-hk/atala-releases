**New Features:**

- **Open Enterprise Agent**:
  - Starting from version v1.19.0, Open Enterprise Agent introduces Keycloak support as its Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.
    - You can attach an external IAM system to your Open Enterprise Agent instance. It allows you to manage your users and their access to the agent via Keycloak.
    - Instead of using API key authentication, you can now use JWT tokens to authenticate your users. Keycloak issues the tokens which can be used to access the agent API.
    - Please check the following Tenant Onboarding tutorials for more information:
      - [external IAM](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/multitenancy/tenant-onboarding-ext-iam)
      - [Self-service](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/multitenancy/tenant-onboarding-self-service)
      - [Migration from API key to JWT](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/multitenancy/tenant-migration)
  - The optional fields `goal` and `goalCode` are added to the `Connection` protocol when out-of-band invitations are generated. These fields allow you to specify additional information about the invitation. For more info about the fields, check [Aries RFC 0434](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md).
    - Check the updated [REST API reference](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/agent-api/#tag/Connections-Management/operation/createConnection) for more information.
- **PRISM Mediator**:
  - [Discover Features 2.0](https://didcomm.org/discover-features/2.0/) DIDComm V2 protocol is now supported. 
  - Initial web-sockets support added. The feature is currently under testing and is not yet available to use as part of the message pick-up protocol (live mode).
  - Bug fixes and dependency updates.
