**New Features:**

- **Open Enterprise Agent**:
  - ***[BREAKING CHANGE]*** Starting from version v1.19.0, Open Enterprise Agent introduces Keycloak support as its Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.
    - Now, you can attach an external IAM system to your Open Enterprise Agent instance. It allows you to manage your users and their access to the agent via Keycloak.
    - Instead of API key authentication used before, now you can use JWT tokens to authenticate your users. The tokens are issued by Keycloak and can be used to access the agent API.
    - Please, check the following Tenant Onboarding tutorials for more information:
      - [external IAM](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/multitenancy/tenant-onboarding-ext-iam)
      - [Self-service](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/multitenancy/tenant-onboarding-self-service)
      - [Migration from API key to JWT](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/tutorials/multitenancy/tenant-migration)
  - `goal` and `goalCode` optional fields added to the `Connection` protocol when out-of-band invitations are generated. They fields allow you to specify additional information about the inviation. For more info about the fields, check [Aries RFC 0434](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md).
    - Check the updated [REST API reference](https://staging-docs.atalaprism.io/agent-api/#tag/Connections-Management/operation/createConnection) for more information.
- **PRISM Mediator**:
  - [Discover Features 2.0](https://didcomm.org/discover-features/2.0/) DIDComm V2 protocol is now supported. 
  - Initial websockets support added. The feature is currently under the testing phase and is not yet available to use as part of message pick-up protocol (live mode).
  - Bug fixes and dependency updates.
