- Re-implemented Pluto which is now available again to all the users.

```typescript
import SDK from "@atala/prism-wallet-sdk";
import IndexDB from "@pluto-encrypted/indexdb";

const store = new SDK.Store({ name: "test", storage: IndexDB, password: Buffer.from("demoapp").toString("hex") });
const pluto = new SDK.Pluto(store, apollo);
```
